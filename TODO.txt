GAME ENGINE AND DYNAMICS (mostly Gio):

 * Death superposition (bug in visualization order)

 * Fix DST TZ selection during automatic turn advancement.

 * Fix long day selection during weekend.

 * Ignore power usages and votes of player that are going to be
   disqualified

TESTS (mostly Giove):

 * Update mayor tests checking SetMayorEvent.cause [low priority].

INTERFACE (mostly Giove):

 * Interface: fix labels of target selections when using power.

 * Factor of the snippets "if target == '': target = None" in
   CommandForm.clean().

 * Double comments: when refreshing after having posted a comment, the
   comment is posted again. The server should detect the double
   posting and avoid getting confused by it.

MYSTERIOUS:

 * Ipnotista being revived as Ghost without power

 * Messia superposition

OTHER:

 * Deploy server and make human tests (possibly with Leonardo and Sasha).

 * Tool for simulating future phases.

 * Write initial mayor letter.

FOR THE FUTURE:

 * Make Marta write the weather descriptions.

 * Il link alla pagina "Designa successore" (per il Sindaco) non deve comparire durante il prologo.

 * Correggere la parte delle ambientazioni che descrive le conoscenze iniziali tra i ruoli (Ipnotista conosce Scrutatori, etc., Rinnegati e Sequestratori non conoscono i Profanatori di Tombe [che non esistono pi√π])

 * Add NoMovementKnowledgeEvent (or something similar) for Stalker and Voyeur, in case they do not see anyone (so that, in the interface, a string is displayed). Reason: every year, a Voyeur or a Stalker ask me if it is correct that they don't obtain any feedback.

 * When last Negromante is dying, they cannot ghostify anyone.
