GAME ENGINE AND DYNAMICS (mostly Gio):

 * Mayor or appointed mayor being exiled

 * Mayor change events (unify and cover all cases)

 * Death superposition (bug in visualization order)

 * Refactor end-of-turn checks

 * Fix DST TZ selection during automatic turn advancement

 * Events before beginning of turn are silently ignored

TESTS (mostly Giove):

 * Tests of complicated voting scenarios (with Ipnotista, Fantasma
   dell'Ipnosi, Scrutatore, ...), particularly considering quorum.

 * Test disqualification of a player (generating a
   DisqualificationEvent) and checking that they get properly
   disqualified (they became exiled, for instance).

 * Test that effects of Spettro dell'Ipnosi, Avvocato del Diavolo and
   Scrutatore do not persis in subsequent turns.

 * Exile the Negromanti team after Ipnotista hypnotized at least
   another player and check that now that player votes correctly.

 * Exile mayor and appointed mayor and check that they get properly
   substituted (both together and in both orders). Use
   DisqualificationEvent for exiling a single player.

INTERFACE (mostly Giove):

 * Update prototypes and letters' templates.

 * Two TODOs in views.py: probably it is enough to filter on game ==
   Game.get_running_game()

MYSTERIOUS:

 * Ipnotista being revived as Ghost without power

 * Messia superposition
