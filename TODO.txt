GAME ENGINE AND DYNAMICS (mostly Gio):

 * Mayor or appointed mayor being exiled

 * Mayor change events (unify and cover all cases)

 * Death superposition (bug in visualization order)

 * Refactor end-of-turn checks

 * Fix DST TZ selection during automatic turn advancement

 * Events before beginning of turn are silently ignored

TESTS (mostly Giove):

 * Exile mayor and appointed mayor and check that they get properly
   substituted (both together and in both orders). Use
   DisqualificationEvent for exiling a single player.

 * Check that RoleKnowledgeEvents are properly created when
   ghostifying the Ipnotista (just in case, check that the same test
   is in place for Fantasma).

 * Test Ipnotista and Spettro dell'Ipnosi acting on the same player.

 * Test Spettro dell'Ipnosi acting on an Ipnotista (what is supposed
   to happen?).

INTERFACE (mostly Giove):

 * Update prototypes and letters' templates.

 * Two TODOs in views.py: probably it is enough to filter on game ==
   Game.get_running_game()

MYSTERIOUS:

 * Ipnotista being revived as Ghost without power

 * Messia superposition
