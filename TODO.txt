 * Fix DST TZ selection during automatic turn advancement

TESTS (mostly Giove):

INTERFACE (mostly Giove):

 * Update prototypes and letters' templates.

   Game.get_running_game()

 * Check that session timeout is reasonably short.

TO DECIDE:

 * Power usages and votes of player that are going to be disqualified
