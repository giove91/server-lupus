GAME ENGINE AND DYNAMICS (mostly Gio):

 * Death superposition (bug in visualization order).

 * Ignore power usages and votes of players that are going to be
   disqualified.

 * Profile dynamics creation and destruction.

 * Profile query and memory usage in the dynamics.

TESTS (mostly Giove):

 * Update mayor tests checking SetMayorEvent.cause [low priority].

INTERFACE (mostly Giove):

 * Create a variable that shows all the information (to be used after
   the end of the match, instead of doing that manually).

MYSTERIOUS:

 * Messia superposition

 * Interface: fix labels of target selections when using power.

OTHER:

 * In prototypes and letter templates: Fantasma should have black aura.

FOR THE FUTURE:

 * When last Negromante is dying, they cannot ghostify anyone.

 * Make Marta write the weather descriptions.
