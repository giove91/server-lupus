GAME ENGINE AND DYNAMICS (mostly Gio):

 * Mayor or appointed mayor being exiled

 * Mayor change events (unify and cover all cases)

 * Death superposition (bug in visualization order)

 * Refactor end-of-turn checks

 * Fix DST TZ selection during automatic turn advancement

 * Events before beginning of turn are silently ignored

TESTS (mostly Giove):

 * TODO in tests.py

 * Tests of complicated voting scenarios (with Ipnotista, Fantasma
   dell'Ipnosi, Scrutatore, ...), particularly considering quorum.

INTERFACE (mostly Giove):

 * Update prototypes and letters' templates.

 * Two TODOs in views.py: probably it is enough to filter on game ==
   Game.get_running_game()

MYSTERIOUS:

 * Ipnotista being revived as Ghost without power

 * Messia superposition
